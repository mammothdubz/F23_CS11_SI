# Instructions
**Objective:** Write a basic calculator using if statements.

## Background information 
If statements are the foundation of control flow in most programming languages. You should be able to break down complex decisions into some number of if statements. To practice this, we are going to be making a calculator which takes in two numbers (doubles) from standard in as well as an operator (used to indicate if the operation is multiplication, addition, etc.), then outputs the result of that operation.

## Hints
1. Use a whiteboard to draw out the flow of the program. What are the possible calculations we want to do based on the variables provided. Which variables "tell us" which calculation we want to do?
2. How can we use a comparison operator on one of our variables to figure out which calculation we should compute?


## Test Cases
```
Test 1:
Enter the first number: 35
Which operation? (* / + -): +
Enter the second number: 35
Result is: 70
```
```
Test 2:
Enter the first number: 89
Which operation? (* / + -): -
Enter the second number: 27
Result is: 62
```
```
Test 3:
Enter the first number: 3.14159
Which operation? (* / + -): *
Enter the second number: 1.41421
Result is: 4.44287
```
```
Test 4:
Enter the first number: 24
Which operation? (* / + -): /
Enter the second number: 7
Result is: 3.42857
